	<h1><span style="color: #008080;">Hello world! I'm Alice Mikulina and I study at ITMO University!</span></h1>
	<h3>I love writing short stories in English, and think I'm really good at short stories overall (everyone says the same). Take a look at my favourite one :)</h3>

	<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>Living room in a tiny flat in Ufa. The room is empty but for an old sofa and a picture of a tree on the wall. The wallpaper is peeling off, the door is squeaky. Time: 23:56</em></span></p>
	<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>[Albine is sitting on the sofa curled up, reading Hamlet. Iskander enters.]</em></span></p>
	<h4>ALBINE.</h4>
	<p>Hey, what are you doing here? And still not asleep? It is becoming unbearable, I can&rsquo;t stand it when you&rsquo;re not asleep so late!!! What a stupid son I have!</p>
	<h4>ISKANDER.</h4>
	<p>Everything worked out. Things are good. I&rsquo;ve managed.</p>
	<h4>ALBINE.</h4>
	<p>What have you managed? To annoy me? Yes, you&rsquo;ve always been remarkably good at driving me mad. Here you go!</p>
	<h4>ISKANDER. <span style="color: #008000;"><em>[in a raised manner]</em></span></h4>
	<p>It&rsquo;s not necessary to throw your worthless Hamlets at me, I&rsquo;ve done nothing to you, mum, you know!</p>
	<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>[Sivilla enters the room, looks at Iskander, then at Albine, then at Hamlet on the floor. Picks up Hamlet.]</em></span></p>
	<h4>SIVILLA.</h4>
	<p>I totally agree with you, mum. Iskander is worthless. I&rsquo;m definitely better a kid than he is. Here you go, Iskander.</p>
	<h4>ISKANDER.</h4>
	<p>And I have done nothing bad to you definitely, sis. And why do you throw Hamlet at me and not a slipper, as usual? Lost it? You always lose everything and you are dumb, so don&rsquo;t underestimate yourself, you&rsquo;re as hopeless as I am.</p>
	<h4>ALBINE.</h4>
	<p>Anyways, what have you managed? Definitely something that wasn&rsquo;t even worth a struggle, was it?</p>
	<h4>ISKANDER.</h4>
	<p>Well, if you wish it to be this way, then it definitely is. I&rsquo;ve closed the deadline. Solved an unsolvable task, you know. I was despairingly trying to work out the answers for six hours, and scored 91%, can you imagine? You should be elated by the fact I&rsquo;m so brainy and able.</p>
	<h4>ALBINE. <span style="color: #008000;"><em>[with a smirk]</em></span></h4>
	<p>Yes, indeed, my son can&rsquo;t even solve a task perfectly well and get a 100% grade, of course I should be happy, shouldn&rsquo;t I?</p>
	<h4>SIVILLA.</h4>
	<p>Hah, yes, mum, he&rsquo;s useless. Totally.</p>
	<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>[Sivilla goes to the kitchen, returns. A rotten </em><em>pear </em><em>flies right in Iskander&rsquo;s face.]</em></span></p>
